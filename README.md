# ai-jail

A sandbox wrapper for AI coding agents (Linux: `bwrap`, macOS: `sandbox-exec`). Isolates tools like Claude Code, GPT Codex, OpenCode, and Crush so they can only access what you explicitly allow.

```

### From source

```bash
cargo build --release
cp target/release/ai-jail ~/.local/bin/
```

### Dependencies

- Linux: [bubblewrap](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap) (`bwrap`) must be installed:
  - Arch: `pacman -S bubblewrap`
  - Debian/Ubuntu: `apt install bubblewrap`
  - Fedora: `dnf install bubblewrap`
  - If `bwrap` is in a non-standard location (e.g. Nix store), set `BWRAP_BIN=/absolute/path/to/bwrap`.
  - The Nix flake package already sets `BWRAP_BIN` automatically.
- macOS: `/usr/bin/sandbox-exec` is used (legacy/deprecated Apple interface).

#### Ubuntu 24.04+ / Debian 13+ users

These distros ship an AppArmor policy that denies unprivileged user namespace creation, which is how `bwrap` isolates the sandbox. If `ai-jail` fails with `bwrap: setting up uid map: Permission denied`, you need to either relax the system-wide restriction or install a local AppArmor profile for `bwrap`. This affects every tool that uses rootless user namespaces (Distrobox, rootless Podman, Flatpak from non-standard paths, etc.), not just ai-jail.

Option A — relax the restriction system-wide (simplest):

```bash
echo 'kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=0' \
  | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/60-userns.conf
sudo sysctl --system
```

Option B — install an unconfined profile for `bwrap` only (keeps the rest of the policy intact):

```bash
sudo tee /etc/apparmor.d/bwrap >/dev/null <<'EOF'
abi <abi/4.0>,
include <tunables/global>
profile bwrap /usr/bin/bwrap flags=(unconfined) {
  userns,
  include if exists <local/bwrap>
}
EOF
sudo systemctl reload apparmor
```

Pick whichever matches your threat model. We don't ship a profile with ai-jail itself because the profile has to apply to `bwrap`, which is system-owned.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd ~/Projects/my-app

# Run Claude Code in a sandbox
ai-jail claude

# Run bash inside the sandbox (for debugging)
ai-jail bash

# See what the sandbox would do without running it
ai-jail --dry-run claude
```

On first run, `ai-jail` creates a `.ai-jail` config file in the current directory by default. Subsequent runs reuse that config. Commit `.ai-jail` to your repo so the sandbox settings follow the project. Use `--no-save-config` for ephemeral runs without creating or updating the project config.

If you run `ai-jail` from a linked Git worktree, it auto-detects the worktree's external Git admin directories and exposes them safely inside the sandbox so `git status`, `git commit`, and similar commands keep working. Disable this with `--no-worktree` or `no_worktree = true`.

## Security notes

The default mode favors usability over maximum lockdown. These are intentionally open by default:

1. Docker socket passthrough auto-enables when `/var/run/docker.sock` exists (`--no-docker` disables it).
2. Display passthrough mounts `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` on Linux, which can expose host IPC sockets.
3. Environment variables are inherited (tokens/secrets in your shell env are visible in-jail).

**Hiding project-level secrets**: the project directory is mounted in its entirety, so files like `.env`, `credentials.json`, or `secrets.yml` are visible to whatever runs inside. Use `--mask PATH` to replace them with empty files inside the sandbox. Example:

```bash
ai-jail --mask .env --mask .env.local claude
```

Or persist the list in `.ai-jail`:

```toml
mask = [".env", ".env.local", "credentials.json"]
```

**Private home mode**: use `--private-home` when you want the project writable
but do not want normal host dotdirs like `~/.config`, `~/.cache`, `~/.local`,
or AI tool state mounted into the sandbox. Explicit mounts still apply.
On Linux, this uses a tmpfs `$HOME`; on macOS, seatbelt rules deny normal
host-home reads/writes instead.

```bash
ai-jail --private-home claude
ai-jail --private-home --rw-map ~/Downloads/test-data bash
```

### Defense-in-depth layers (Linux)

ai-jail applies multiple overlapping security layers:

- **Namespace isolation** (bwrap): PID, UTS, IPC, mount namespaces. Network namespace in lockdown.
- **Landlock LSM** (V3 filesystem + V4 network): VFS-level access control independent of mount namespaces.
- **Seccomp-bpf** syscall filter: blocks ~30 dangerous syscalls (module loading, `ptrace`, `bpf`, namespace escape, etc.). Lockdown blocks additional NUMA/hostname syscalls.
- **Resource limits**: RLIMIT_NPROC (4096/1024 lockdown), RLIMIT_NOFILE (65536/4096 lockdown), RLIMIT_CORE=0. Prevents fork bombs and limits resource abuse.
- **Sensitive /sys masking**: tmpfs overlays hide `/sys/firmware`, `/sys/kernel/security`, `/sys/kernel/debug`, `/sys/fs/fuse`. Lockdown also masks `/sys/module`, `/sys/devices/virtual/dmi`, `/sys/class/net`.

Each layer can be individually disabled (`--no-seccomp`, `--no-rlimits`, `--no-landlock`) if it causes issues.

For hostile/untrusted workloads, use `--lockdown` (see below).

## What this is and isn't

ai-jail is a thin wrapper around OS-level sandboxing, so its security properties depend on the backend:

- `bwrap` (Linux): namespace + mount sandboxing in userspace, plus Landlock LSM for VFS-level access control (Linux 5.13+).
- `sandbox-exec` / seatbelt (macOS): legacy policy interface to Apple sandbox rules.

Some things to keep in mind:

- All backends depend on host kernel correctness. Kernel escapes are out of scope.
- These are process sandboxes, not hardware isolation. A VM runs a separate kernel and gives a stronger boundary.
- Timing/cache side channels and scheduler interference still exist in process sandboxes.
- Linux and macOS primitives are not equivalent; cross-platform policy parity is approximate.
- `sandbox-exec` on macOS is a deprecated interface. It works today but Apple could remove it.

If you need full isolation against unknown malware, use a disposable VM and treat ai-jail as one layer, not the whole story.

## Lockdown mode

`--lockdown` switches to strict read-only, ephemeral behavior for hostile workloads.

```bash
ai-jail --lockdown claude
```

This:

- Mounts the project read-only.
- Disables GPU, Docker, display passthrough, and mise.
- Ignores `--rw-map` and `--map` flags.
- Mounts `$HOME` as bare tmpfs (no host dotfiles).
- Still exposes validated linked Git worktree metadata read-only when needed, so read-only Git operations can work from linked worktrees.
- Linux: `--clearenv` with minimal allowlist, `--unshare-net`, `--new-session`.
- macOS: clears env to minimal allowlist, strips network and file-write rules from SBPL profile.

Persistence: `--lockdown` alone doesn't write `.ai-jail` (keeps runs ephemeral). Persist it with `ai-jail --init --lockdown`. Undo with `--no-lockdown`.

`--init` always writes config, so it cannot be combined with `--no-save-config`.

## Browser profiles

ai-jail can run browsers in a separate locked-down browser profile. Browser commands are auto-detected for Chromium, Chrome, Brave, Firefox, and LibreWolf, or you can opt in explicitly:

```bash
ai-jail chromium              # auto: hard browser profile
ai-jail --browser chromium    # explicit hard profile
ai-jail --browser=soft firefox
ai-jail --no-browser chromium # disable browser auto-profile
```

Both browser profiles avoid the real host browser profiles. They use a private `$HOME`, keep the project mounted read-only, skip SSH keys, Docker, linked worktree metadata, extra maps, mise, config auto-save, and the terminal status bar. Display and network stay enabled so the browser can actually open and navigate sites.

- **Hard profile** (`--browser` / `--browser=hard`): all browser config, cache, history, cookies, extension state, and sessions live under sandbox tmpfs paths and disappear when the browser exits.
- **Soft profile** (`--browser=soft`): browser state survives only under `~/.local/share/ai-jail/browsers/<browser>`, so future ai-jail browser sessions can keep logins and history without touching `~/.config/chromium`, `~/.mozilla`, or other real browser profiles.

Chromium-family browsers run with Chromium's internal sandbox disabled inside ai-jail because the Chromium zygote/setuid sandbox does not work reliably through the bwrap/user namespace setup. The containment boundary is ai-jail's bwrap mount/process namespace plus Landlock/seccomp, not Chromium's own sandbox. Browser profiles also disable browser GPU acceleration by default to avoid probing unmapped DRM devices; pass `--gpu` if you want ai-jail to expose GPU devices and leave Chromium GPU acceleration enabled.

Expected Chromium terminal noise: D-Bus, systemd, UPower, Google Cloud Messaging, and EGL/WebGPU warnings can appear because browser profiles deliberately do not expose the host system bus or full desktop session. These messages are usually harmless if the browser window works. `--gpu` may add EGL/WebGPU capability warnings; omit `--gpu` for the quieter default software path.

This is useful for testing suspect extensions or websites without giving them read-write access to your normal home directory or browser profile. It is not an anonymity feature: the browser still has network access, sites can fingerprint it, and anything you log into can identify you.

## What gets sandboxed

### Default behavior (no flags needed)

| Resource | Access | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `/usr`, `/etc`, `/opt`, `/sys` | read-only | System binaries and config |
| `/dev`, `/proc` | device/proc | Standard device and process access |
| `/tmp`, `/run` | tmpfs | Fresh temp dirs per session |
| `$HOME` | tmpfs | Empty home, then dotfiles layered on top |
| Project directory (pwd) | **read-write** | The whole point |
| Linked Git worktree metadata | auto passthrough | Validated `.git` gitfile targets are mounted when the current directory is a linked worktree |
| GPU devices (`/dev/nvidia*`, `/dev/dri`) | device | For GPU-accelerated tools |
| Docker socket | read-write | If `/var/run/docker.sock` exists |
| X11/Wayland | passthrough | Display server access |
| `/dev/shm` | device | Shared memory (Chromium needs this) |

In `--lockdown`, project is mounted read-only and host write mounts are removed. For linked Git worktrees, validated external Git metadata is still exposed read-only unless disabled with `--no-worktree`.

In browser profile mode, the project is mounted read-only, `$HOME` is private tmpfs, normal host dotdirs are not mounted, and soft browser state is the only persistent browser-specific write mount.

In `--private-home` mode, normal host dotdirs are not exposed, but the project remains read-write and explicit `--map` / `--rw-map` mounts still work. On Linux this is a private tmpfs `$HOME`; on macOS it is enforced with seatbelt read/write allowlists because `sandbox-exec` cannot create a replacement home mount. This is useful for non-agent or experimental workloads where you want normal project access without exposing your real `~/.config`, `~/.cache`, or tool state.

### Home directory handling

Your real `$HOME` is replaced with a tmpfs. Dotfiles and dotdirs are selectively layered on top:

Pass `--private-home` or set `private_home = true` to skip this automatic dotdir layering entirely. `--ssh`, `--pictures`, `--map`, and `--rw-map` remain explicit opt-ins. On macOS, `sandbox-exec` does not provide tmpfs mounts, so ai-jail approximates this by denying normal host-home reads and writes.

**Never mounted (sensitive data):**
- `.gnupg`, `.aws`, `.ssh`, `.mozilla`, `.basilisk-dev`, `.sparrow`

**Mounted read-write (AI tools and build caches):**
- `.gemini`, `.claude`, `.crush`, `.codex`, `.aider`, `.config`, `.cargo`, `.cache`, `.docker`

**Everything else:** mounted read-only.

**Hidden behind tmpfs:**
- `~/.config/BraveSoftware`, `~/.config/Bitwarden`
- `~/.cache/BraveSoftware`, `~/.cache/chromium`, `~/.cache/spotify`, `~/.cache/nvidia`, `~/.cache/mesa_shader_cache`, `~/.cache/basilisk-dev`

**Explicit file mounts:**
- `~/.gitconfig` (read-only)
- `~/.claude.json` (read-write)
- Validated linked Git worktree admin dirs outside the project tree (auto, same-path passthrough)

**Local overrides (read-write):**
- `~/.local/state`
- `~/.local/share/{zoxide,crush,opencode,atuin,mise,yarn,flutter,kotlin,NuGet,pipx,ruby-advisory-db,uv}`

### Namespace isolation

PID, UTS, and IPC namespaces are isolated. Hostname inside is `ai-sandbox`. The process dies when the parent exits (`--die-with-parent`).
`--new-session` is on for non-interactive runs and always in `--lockdown`. In `--lockdown`, Linux also unshares network.

### Landlock LSM (Linux)

On Linux 5.13+, ai-jail applies [Landlock](https://landlock.io/) restrictions as defense-in-depth on top of bwrap. Landlock controls what the process can do at the VFS level, independent of mount namespaces. This closes attack vectors that bwrap alone doesn't cover: `/proc` escape routes, symlink tricks within allowed mounts, and acts as insurance against namespace bugs.

- Uses ABI V3 (Linux 6.2+) for filesystem rules with best-effort degradation to V1 on 5.13+ or no-op on older kernels.
- On Linux 6.5+, a second V4 ruleset adds network restrictions: lockdown mode denies all TCP bind/connect (defense-in-depth alongside `--unshare-net`).
- Applied after bwrap namespace setup via an internal wrapper, so Landlock sees the final sandbox mount layout.
- In `--lockdown`, Landlock rules are stricter: project is read-only, no home dotdirs, only `/tmp` is writable, no network.
- Disable with `--no-landlock` if it causes issues with specific tools.

### Status bar

Enable a persistent status line on the bottom row of your terminal:

```bash
ai-jail -s claude          # dark theme
ai-jail -s=light claude    # light theme
```

The bar shows the project path, running command, ai-jail version, and a green `↑` when an update is available. It uses a PTY proxy to keep the bar visible even when the child application resets the screen. The preference is stored in `$HOME/.ai-jail` and persists across sessions.

**Why it exists**: when you run several AI CLI agents in parallel (one per terminal window / split), it's easy to lose track of which window is bound to which project. The status bar keeps the project path and the running command visible at all times so you can't accidentally paste the wrong context into the wrong agent.

**Auto-disabled inside tmux and zellij.** Those tools already render a persistent status line and already own the terminal; ai-jail's PTY proxy is redundant and causes conflicts (nested PTYs, resize flicker, lost keyboard-protocol sequences, no Secure Input propagation). When ai-jail detects `$TMUX` or `$ZELLIJ` in the environment it silently skips the status bar and takes the direct-spawn path, letting the multiplexer drive the terminal. To force the ai-jail bar on anyway, pass `-s` explicitly or set `no_status_bar = false` in `~/.ai-jail`.

When running `codex` through the PTY proxy, ai-jail also injects a redraw key on terminal resize to force the app to repaint at the new width. The default is `ctrl-shift-l` for codex sessions. In practice, terminals collapse shifted control letters, so `ctrl-shift-l` and `ctrl-l` send the same control byte to the app.

Override or disable that global behavior in `$HOME/.ai-jail`:

```toml
status_bar_style = "pastel"
resize_redraw_key = "ctrl-l"
# or:
# resize_redraw_key = "disabled"
```

### mise integration

If [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) is found on `$PATH`, the sandbox automatically runs `mise trust && mise activate bash && mise env` before your command. This gives AI tools access to project-specific language versions. Disable with `--no-mise`.

## Usage

```
ai-jail [OPTIONS] [--] [COMMAND [ARGS...]]
```

### Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `gemini` | Run Gemini CLI |
| `claude` | Run Claude Code |
| `codex` | Run GPT Codex |
| `opencode` | Run OpenCode |
| `crush` | Run Crush |
| `bash` | Drop into a bash shell |
| `status` | Show current `.ai-jail` config |
| Any other | Passed through as the command |

If no command is given and no `.ai-jail` config exists, defaults to `bash`.

### Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--rw-map <PATH>` | Mount PATH read-write (repeatable) |
| `--map <PATH>` | Mount PATH read-only (repeatable) |
| `--hide-dotdir <NAME>` | Never bind-mount the named home dotdir into the sandbox (e.g. `.my_secrets`). Leading dot is optional. Repeatable. Cannot hide dotdirs required for tool operation (`.cargo`, `.config`, `.cache`, etc.) — those emit a warning and stay visible. |
| `--mask <PATH>` | Replace `PATH` inside the sandbox with an empty file (or empty tmpfs if the path is a directory). Relative paths resolve against the project directory. Repeatable. Useful for hiding sensitive files like `.env`, `credentials.json` from AI agents while keeping the rest of the project accessible. Missing paths are skipped with a warning. |
| `--allow-tcp-port <PORT>` | Permit outbound TCP to PORT in lockdown mode (repeatable). Skips `--unshare-net` and uses Landlock V4 `NetPort` rules to deny everything else. Requires Linux ≥ 6.5; hard-fails otherwise. No effect outside lockdown or on macOS. |
| `--private-home` / `--no-private-home` | Enable/disable private home mode. Private home skips automatic host dotdir passthrough while leaving the project writable and explicit maps active. Linux uses tmpfs `$HOME`; macOS uses seatbelt allowlists. |
| `--lockdown` / `--no-lockdown` | Enable/disable strict read-only lockdown mode |
| `--landlock` / `--no-landlock` | Enable/disable Landlock LSM (Linux 5.13+, default: on) |
| `--seccomp` / `--no-seccomp` | Enable/disable seccomp syscall filter (Linux, default: on) |
| `--rlimits` / `--no-rlimits` | Enable/disable resource limits (default: on) |
| `--gpu` / `--no-gpu` | Enable/disable GPU passthrough |
| `--docker` / `--no-docker` | Enable/disable Docker socket |
| `--display` / `--no-display` | Enable/disable X11/Wayland |
| `--worktree` / `--no-worktree` | Enable/disable linked Git worktree metadata passthrough (default: on) |
| `--mise` / `--no-mise` | Enable/disable mise integration |
| `--ssh` / `--no-ssh` | Share `~/.ssh` read-only + forward `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` (default: off) |
| `--pictures` / `--no-pictures` | Share `~/Pictures` read-only (default: off) |
| `--browser[=PROFILE]` / `--no-browser` | Enable/disable browser isolation profile. `PROFILE` is `hard` (ephemeral, default) or `soft` (persistent under `~/.local/share/ai-jail/browsers/<browser>`). Common browser commands auto-enable `hard` unless disabled. |
| `--save-config` / `--no-save-config` | Enable/disable automatic `.ai-jail` writes |
| `-s`, `--status-bar[=STYLE]` | Enable persistent status line. `STYLE` is `pastel` (default, random palette per session), `dark`, or `light` |
| `--no-status-bar` | Disable persistent status line |
| `--exec` | Direct execution mode (no PTY proxy, no status bar) |
| `--clean` | Ignore existing config, start fresh |
| `--dry-run` | Print the bwrap command without executing |
| `--init` | Create/update config and exit (don't run) |
| `--bootstrap` | Generate smart permission configs for AI tools |

ai-jail --pictures claude

# Run Chromium with an ephemeral browser profile
ai-jail chromium

# Run Firefox with a persistent ai-jail-only browser profile
ai-jail --browser=soft firefox

# Hide .env and other secrets from the agent
ai-jail --mask .env --mask .env.local claude

# Run without creating/updating .ai-jail
ai-jail --no-save-config claude

# Regenerate config from scratch
ai-jail --clean --init claude

# Pass flags through to the sub-command (after --)
ai-jail -- claude --model opus
```

## Config file (`.ai-jail`)

Created in the project directory on first run. Example:

```toml
# ai-jail sandbox configuration
# Edit freely. Regenerate with: ai-jail --clean --init

command = ["claude"]
rw_maps = ["/home/user/Projects/shared-lib"]
ro_maps = []
mask = [".env", ".env.local"]
no_gpu = true
ssh = true
private_home = true
lockdown = true
```

### Merge behavior

When CLI flags and an existing config are both present:

- `command`: CLI replaces config for the current run, but a CLI-passed command is **not** auto-persisted when the project already has a stored command — so `ai-jail codex` after `ai-jail claude` runs codex for that session without rewriting `.ai-jail`'s stored default. Use `ai-jail --init <command>` to explicitly change the stored command. First-run bootstrap (no stored command yet) still persists the CLI command as the new default.
- `rw_maps` / `ro_maps` / `mask`: CLI values are appended (duplicates removed). Paths starting with `~/` or exactly `~` are expanded against `$HOME` at merge time, so you can write `ro_maps = ["~/.bashrc"]` in a config file.
- Boolean flags: CLI overrides config (`--no-gpu` sets `no_gpu = true`)
- `--save-config` / `--no-save-config` override `no_save_config`
- Config is updated after merge in normal mode when config saving is enabled; lockdown skips auto-save

### Available fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `command` | string array | `["bash"]` | Default command to run inside sandbox. Set by first run or by `--init`; not overwritten when a different command is passed on the CLI. |
| `rw_maps` | path array | `[]` | Extra read-write mounts |
| `ro_maps` | path array | `[]` | Extra read-only mounts |
| `hide_dotdirs` | string array | `[]` | Extra home dotdirs to deny (e.g. `[".my_secrets"]`). Leading dot optional. Built-in deny list (`.ssh`, `.gnupg`, `.aws`, `.mozilla`) always applies. |
| `mask` | path array | `[]` | Paths to replace with empty files/tmpfs (e.g. `[".env", "secrets.json"]`). Relative paths resolve against the project directory. |
| `allow_tcp_ports` | u16 array | `[]` | TCP ports permitted outbound in lockdown mode (e.g. `[32000, 8080]`). Requires Linux ≥ 6.5 for Landlock V4. No effect outside lockdown. |
| `private_home` | bool | not set (off) | `true` skips automatic host dotdir passthrough without enabling full lockdown. Project and explicit maps remain writable. Linux uses tmpfs `$HOME`; macOS uses seatbelt allowlists. |
| `no_gpu` | bool | not set (auto) | `true` disables GPU passthrough |
| `no_docker` | bool | not set (auto) | `true` disables Docker socket |
| `no_display` | bool | not set (auto) | `true` disables X11/Wayland |
| `no_worktree` | bool | not set (auto) | `true` disables linked Git worktree metadata passthrough |
| `no_mise` | bool | not set (auto) | `true` disables mise integration |
| `ssh` | bool | not set (off) | `true` shares `~/.ssh` read-only + forwards `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` |
| `pictures` | bool | not set (off) | `true` shares `~/Pictures` read-only |
| `browser_profile` | string | not set (auto) | Browser isolation profile: `"hard"` for ephemeral state, `"soft"` for persistent ai-jail-only state, or `"off"` to disable browser auto-detection |
| `no_save_config` | bool | not set (enabled) | `true` disables automatic `.ai-jail` writes |
| `no_landlock` | bool | not set (auto) | `true` disables Landlock LSM (Linux only) |
| `no_seccomp` | bool | not set (auto) | `true` disables seccomp syscall filter (Linux only) |
| `no_rlimits` | bool | not set (auto) | `true` disables resource limits |
| `lockdown` | bool | not set (disabled) | `true` enables strict read-only lockdown mode |

Status bar preferences (`no_status_bar`, `status_bar_style`, `resize_redraw_key`) are stored in `$HOME/.ai-jail` (global user config), not in per-project `.ai-jail` files. `status_bar_style` accepts `"dark"`, `"light"`, or `"pastel"` — pastel rotates through a curated set of soft pastel palettes (with high-contrast foreground), picking a new one at random for each session. Set it back to `"dark"` or `"light"` to disable the rotation. `resize_redraw_key` is used only by the PTY/status-bar path on terminal resize; accepted values are `ctrl-l`, `ctrl-shift-l` (same wire encoding as `ctrl-l`), or `disabled`. If unset, `codex` gets the `ctrl-shift-l` default and other commands stay off.

When a boolean field is not set, the feature is in auto mode. For resource passthroughs, that means enabled if the resource exists on the host. For Git worktrees, that means enabled only when the current directory is a validated linked worktree. `no_save_config` is exception: when unset, config auto-save is enabled in normal mode.

## Windows

ai-jail doesn't support Windows natively and probably never will. The sandbox depends on Linux namespaces (via bwrap) and macOS seatbelt profiles (via sandbox-exec). Windows has nothing equivalent in userspace. AppContainers exist but they're a completely different API, need admin privileges for setup, and the security model doesn't map to what bwrap does. A Windows port would be a separate project, not a backend swap.

If you're on Windows, run ai-jail inside WSL 2. WSL 2 runs a real Linux kernel, so bwrap works normally.

### Setup

1. Install WSL 2 if you haven't:

```powershell
wsl --install
```

2. Open your WSL distro (Ubuntu by default) and install bubblewrap:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install bubblewrap
```

3. Build ai-jail from source inside WSL:

```bash
cd ~/Projects
git clone https://github.com/nicholasgasior/ai-jail.git
cd ai-jail
cargo build --release
cp target/release/ai-jail ~/.local/bin/
```

4. Run it from inside WSL against your project directory:

```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/you/Projects/my-app
ai-jail claude
```

WSL 2 mounts your Windows drives under `/mnt/c/`, `/mnt/d/`, etc. The sandbox sees the Linux filesystem, so all the mount isolation works as expected. Your Windows files are accessible through those mount points.

One thing to watch: WSL 2 filesystem performance is slower on `/mnt/c/` (the Windows side) than on the native Linux filesystem (`~/`). For large projects, cloning into `~/Projects/` inside WSL instead of working from `/mnt/c/` makes a noticeable difference.
